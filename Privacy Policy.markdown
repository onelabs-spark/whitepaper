# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how One Chain Labs, its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively called "One Chain Labs", "we," "us,") collects, uses, and shares your personal information and to help you understand and exercise your privacy rights in accordance with applicable law, including, but not limited to, the British Virgin Islands Data Protection Act and, in respect of any EU data subjects, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (together, the "Data Protection Legislation"). This Policy applies when you use our websites, contact our team members, engage with us on social media, or otherwise interact with us. If you are an individual, this will affect you directly. If you are an entity that provides us with personal information on individuals connected to you, this will be relevant for those individuals, and you should transmit this Privacy Policy to such individuals or otherwise advise them of its content.

## Scope

This Privacy Policy applies to personal information processed by One Chain Labs, including on our websites (including [onelabs.cc](http://www.onelabs.cc), testnet.onelabs.cc, and docs.onelabs.cc), and other online and offline offerings which link to this Privacy Policy. Such websites and offerings are collectively called the "Services." For clarity, the Services do not include the One Chain Wallet mobile application, the Protocol, or any other decentralized aspect of the One Chain Blockchain that is not controlled by One Chain Labs due to the decentralized nature of the One Chain Blockchain.

## Changes to Our Privacy Policy

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time in our sole discretion. If there are any changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you as required by applicable law. You understand and agree that you will be deemed to have accepted the updated Privacy Policy if you continue to use our Services after the new Privacy Policy takes effect.

## Personal Information We Collect

The categories of personal information we collect depend on how you interact with us, our Services, and the requirements of applicable law. We collect information that you provide to us, information we obtain automatically when you use our Services, and information from other sources such as third-party services and organizations, as described below.

### B. Information Collected Automatically

We may collect personal information automatically when you use our Services:

- **Automatic Data Collection.** We may collect certain information automatically when you use our Services, such as your Internet protocol (IP) address, user settings, MAC address, cookie identifiers, mobile carrier, mobile advertising and other unique identifiers, browser or device information, location information (including approximate location derived from IP address), Internet service provider, and metadata about the content you provide.

- **Pixel Tags/Web Beacons.** A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded in our Services that collects information about engagement on our Services. The use of a pixel tag allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. We may also include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.

### C. Information Collected from Other Sources

## How We Disclose Your Information

We disclose your personal information to third parties for a variety of business purposes, including to provide our Services, to protect us or others, or in the event of a major business transaction such as a merger, sale, or asset transfer, as described below.

**Notice Regarding Use of the Blockchain.** Aspects of our Services may be hosted on or interact with the blockchain. Where you use aspects of our Services that are hosted on or interact with the blockchain, information about your interactions and/or transactions will be provided to the applicable blockchain network and may be accessible to third parties due to the nature of the blockchain protocol. Because entries to the One Chain Blockchain are, by their nature, public, and because it may be possible for someone to identify you through your pseudonymous, public wallet address using external sources of information, any transaction you enter onto the One Chain Blockchain could possibly be used to identify you, or information about you.

### A. Disclosures to Provide Our Services

The categories of third parties with whom we may share your information are described below.

- **Service Providers.** We may share your personal information with our third-party service providers who use that information to help us provide our Services. This includes service providers and vendors that provide us with IT support, hosting, customer service, and related services.
- **Google Analytics.** For more information about how Google uses your data (including for its own purposes, e.g., for profiling or linking it to other data), please visit [Google Analytics’ Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). To learn more about how to opt-out of Google Analytics’ use of your information, please click [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).
- **Microsoft Clarity.** We partner with Microsoft Clarity and Microsoft Advertising to capture how you use and interact with our website through behavioral metrics, heatmaps, and session replay to improve and market our products/services. Website usage data is captured using first and third-party cookies and other tracking technologies to determine the popularity of products/services and online activity. Additionally, we use this information for site optimization, fraud/security purposes, and advertising. For more information about how Microsoft collects and uses your data, visit the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement).

In addition, to complete transfers via the Services, we will need to share some of your personal information with the party that you are transacting with.
- **Advertising Partners.** We may share your personal information with third-party advertising partners. These third-party advertising partners may set Technologies and other tracking tools on our Services to collect information regarding your activities and your device (e.g., your IP address, cookie identifiers, page(s) visited, location, time of day). These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other services) for purposes of delivering personalized advertisements to you when you visit digital properties within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as "interest-based advertising", "targeted advertising," "personalized advertising," or "cross-context behavioral advertising."

### B. Disclosures to Protect Us or Others

## International Data Transfers

All information processed by us may be transferred, processed, and stored anywhere in the world, including, but not limited to, the United States or other countries which may not offer equivalent protection of personal information as under the Data Protection Legislation and otherwise may have data protection laws that are different from the laws where you live. We endeavor to safeguard your information consistent with the requirements of applicable laws, including Data Protection Legislation and, in such cases, we will process personal information or procure that it be processed in accordance with the requirements of the Data Protection Legislation, which may include having appropriate contractual undertakings in legal agreements with service providers who process personal information on our behalf.

If we transfer personal information which originates in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and/or the United Kingdom to a country that has not been found to provide an adequate level of protection under applicable data protection laws, one of the safeguards we may use to support such transfer is the EU Standard Contractual Clauses.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we may consider applicable legal requirements, the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, certain risk factors, the purposes for which we process your personal information, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.

We expect to delete your personal information (at the latest) once there is no longer any legal or regulatory requirement or legitimate business purpose for retaining your personal information.
