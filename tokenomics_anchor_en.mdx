# Tokenomics 

#### The design of OneChain's economic model is based on the principles of stability and sustainable development, combined with the actual needs of the ecosystem, and promotes the prosperity and development of the public chain ecology through the native token OCT and its supporting incentive mechanism.

## 1. OCT Token Overview {/* {#section5-1} */}

#### Total Circulation: 10 billion
#### Token Features: OCT is OneChain’s native token with the following core functions:
- Supports on-chain transactions and payments (GAS fees).
- Incentivizes network nodes for validation and maintenance.
- It is used in the on-chain application ecosystem of payments and value exchanges
- Empower decentralized governance with voting decisions

## 2. Application scenarios for OCT tokens {/* {#section5-2} */}

### On-Chain Transactions and Payments:
- OCT is used to pay all GAS fees on OneChain, and with the One Wallet’s delegated payment feature, it lowers the entry barrier for users.

### Mining Rewards:
- Validators earn OCT rewards by running OneChain’s consensus protocol, promoting long-term commitment to network security and performance.

### Ecosystem Support:
- Developers can apply for OneChain ecological funds in OCT to support DApp development, marketing, and user growth.

### On-Chain Governance:
- OCT holders can vote on protocol upgrades and key decisions like ecological fund usage through on-chain governance.

## 5. On-Chain Governance {/* {#section5-5} */}

#### OneChain's governance system is based on referendums, where anyone can make a proposal, but ultimately needs to be voted on by the community to decide whether to pass or not. Voting power is held by OCT holders, and the voting weight is related to the amount of OCT locked and the locked time (belief multiplier). While nodes (validators) do not directly participate in governance voting, they can participate indirectly by holding OCT tokens.

### Proposal Submission:
- Anyone can submit a proposal, but a deposit is required.
- Proposals need to be endorsed in order to be in the referendum queue.
### Referendum Process:
- Once the proposal is in the queue, it is ranked based on recognition
- The highest-ranked proposal will be put into a referendum and will enter the voting period.

### Voting Rules:
- Users vote by locking OCT, and the more and longer they lock, the higher the weight of their votes.
- The result of the vote needs to reach a certain threshold for passing (e.g., supermajority).
