# Token Economics 

#### OneChain’s economic model is designed for stability and sustainability, leveraging the native token OCT and supporting incentives to drive public chain ecosystem prosperity.

## 1. OCT Token Overview {/* {#section5-1} */}

#### Total Supply: 10 Billion Tokens
#### Token Features: OCT is OneChain’s native token with the following core functions:
- Supports on-chain transactions and payments (GAS fees).
- Incentivizes network nodes for validation and maintenance.
- Facilitates payments and value exchange in the on-chain application ecosystem.
- Empowers decentralized governance and voting.

## 2. OCT Token Use Cases {/* {#section5-2} */}

### On-Chain Transactions and Payments:
- The primary payment medium for all OneChain transactions, covering GAS fees. Combined with OCT Wallet’s delegated payment function, users can pay GAS fees with OCT, significantly lowering usage barriers.

### Mining Rewards:
- Validator nodes earn OCT rewards by running OneChain’s consensus protocol, encouraging long-term participation in maintaining network security and efficiency.

### Ecosystem Support:
- OneChain supports developers with OCT-funded ecosystem grants for DApp development, marketing, and user acquisition.

### On-Chain Governance:
- OCT holders participate in governance, voting on protocol upgrades and ecosystem fund allocation decisions.

  - Rewards the founding team and core developers, incentivizing long-term maintenance and development. Lockup mechanism: Team rewards vest gradually, typically over 5 years (20% annual release), aligning team and ecosystem interests.
- **Advisors & Partners (5%)**:
  - Engages strategic partners and investors for OneChain’s long-term growth, fostering deep collaboration with traditional businesses and other blockchain projects.
- **Presale (8%)**:
  - Funds initial operations and early circulation, supporting public chain launch and early ecosystem building.
- **Nodes (27%)**:
  - Supports various nodes for initial operations and ecosystem development post-launch.
- **Liquidity (5%)**:
  - Ensures token liquidity support.
- **DAO & Airdrop (10%)**:
  - Funds DAO governance and community operations.
- **Public Sale & Exchanges (5%)**:
  - Supports public sales and exchange fees.

## 5. On-Chain Governance {/* {#section5-5} */}

#### OneChain’s governance system is referendum-based, allowing anyone to submit proposals, which are finalized through community voting. Voting rights are held by OCT holders, with weight tied to the amount and duration of locked OCT (belief multiplier). Nodes (validators) do not directly vote but can participate indirectly by holding OCT.

### Proposal Submission:
- Anyone can submit proposals but must pay a deposit.
- Proposals must be endorsed to enter the referendum queue.

### Referendum Process:
- Proposals in the queue are ranked by endorsement level.
- The highest-ranked proposal becomes a referendum, entering the voting period.

### Voting Rules:
- Users vote by locking OCT; longer and larger locks increase voting weight.
- Voting outcomes require a specific approval threshold (e.g., supermajority).
