# 1. Background {/* {#section1} */}

In an era of rapid digital economy development, blockchain technology is redefining trust and collaboration. However, despite many platforms excelling in technical performance, their ecosystems are limited by a lack of practical application scenarios. The world needs a **high-performance, user-friendly, and cost-effective** blockchain platform to provide groundbreaking solutions for real-world applications (Web2).

![ONECHAIN WALLSTREET 3.0](https://statics-testnet.onelabs.cc/wallstreet_en.png "Wallstreet")

Over the past 150 years, the global financial system has evolved from bank-dominated capital markets through the industrial revolution, information revolution, and now the digital finance era. By the late 19th century, modern banking systems took shape, with central banks controlling money supply and commercial banks managing capital flows, accelerating global financial market formation. In the 20th century, stock exchanges, credit systems, and electronic payment systems emerged, making financial markets more complex and efficient. However, the 2008 financial crisis exposed vulnerabilities in the traditional banking system, with excessive leverage and opaque financial transactions leading to global economic turmoil. People began questioning the stability of centralized financial systems and seeking new financial models. In 2009, Bitcoin's emergence marked the start of the decentralized finance era. Bitcoin offered a global payment method independent of banks, while Ethereum’s smart contracts enabled blockchain-based financial applications. Decentralized finance (DeFi) grew rapidly, allowing lending, trading, and payments to operate directly on the blockchain without banks or financial institutions.

This transformation is ushering in a new era of global finance—Wall Street 3.0.

## 1.1 WallStreet 1.0: The Rise and Fall of Traditional Banking Systems {/* {#section1-1} */}

For over a century, the global financial system has been dominated by banks, with central banks setting monetary policies and commercial banks providing loans, payments, and investment services. Financial markets were regulated by governments to ensure stability and credit system operations. While this system drove global economic growth, it had significant drawbacks.

First, the banking system is highly centralized, with financial resources and power concentrated in the hands of a few financial giants. Ordinary users’ assets are held by banks, preventing true control over their wealth. Second, transaction costs are high, with banks charging substantial fees as intermediaries, especially for cross-border payments, which are complex and expensive. Additionally, transactions are slow, with cross-border settlements often taking days due to reliance on traditional clearing and approval processes.

More critically, billions of people worldwide remain unbanked, excluded from modern financial systems. The flaws of traditional banking—lack of transparency, inefficiency, and limited access—prevent ordinary people from accessing quality financial services.

## 1.2 WallStreet 2.0: The Rise and Limitations of Fintech {/* {#section1-2} */}

In the 21st century, the internet and mobile technology spurred the rise of financial technology (Fintech), making financial services more digital and convenient. Online payment tools like Alipay, PayPal, and Stripe made transfers and payments more efficient. Mobile banking, robo-advisors, and algorithmic trading enabled users to manage wealth anytime, anywhere.

However, despite improving transaction efficiency, Fintech did not fundamentally change the financial system. Fintech companies remain subject to traditional banking regulations and rely on banks for clearing and asset storage. Moreover, financial markets remain highly fragmented, with users’ assets managed independently across platforms, lacking interoperability. For example, stocks invested via Robinhood cannot be directly transferred to another platform, and bank deposits cannot be seamlessly used for crypto investments. This fragmented system restricts the free flow of funds and users’ control over their assets.

Additionally, entering the Fintech market remains challenging due to banking licenses and regulatory constraints, making it difficult for startups to challenge the core dominance of traditional banks. Thus, while Fintech has made financial services more convenient, it has not addressed the core limitations of centralized financial systems.

## 1.3 WallStreet 3.0: Decentralized Finance and the Public Chain Revolution {/* {#section1-3} */}

Today, the financial world is entering the Wall Street 3.0 era, with blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi) forming the core of a new financial system. Unlike traditional finance, DeFi eliminates reliance on banks, using smart contracts and blockchain to enable users to freely store, trade, and lend assets without intermediaries. DeFi is breaking the banking monopoly, making financial transactions more transparent and efficient, and giving users true control over their assets. Despite challenges in regulation, market maturity, and compliance, the growth of blockchain finance is unstoppable. As more traditional financial institutions enter the crypto market, the integration of crypto and traditional finance will accelerate, moving the global financial system toward a more equitable and open future.

Blockchain finance’s greatest strengths are fairness, transparency, low cost, real-time processing, and 24/7 availability. All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, publicly verifiable, and tamper-proof, significantly enhancing trust in the financial system. Users can freely transfer assets between DeFi protocols, with transaction settlements completed in seconds—far faster than traditional banking’s multi-day processes. Anyone, anywhere, can create, own, and trade assets, granting individuals greater control and realizing the true value of the internet. Blockchain benefits people, not platforms, eliminating untrustworthy intermediaries and protecting privacy. Direct digital ownership empowers everyone, enabling the internet’s full potential. DeFi is dismantling banking monopolies, making transactions more transparent and efficient, and giving users true asset control. Despite regulatory and maturity challenges, blockchain finance’s growth is irreversible. As traditional institutions embrace this shift, crypto finance is becoming a key component of the global financial system, enabling seamless cross-border payments and value storage. With increasing institutional capital inflows, crypto finance is gradually becoming integral to global finance.

### 3.7.1 DPoS (Delegated Proof-of-Stake) {/* {#section3-7-1} */}

- **Staking Mechanism**:
  - Users delegate their voting power to validators by staking OCT, OneChain's native token.
  - Validators are weighted based on the amount of OCT staked and are responsible for block generation and transaction validation.
  - This mechanism not only lowers the barrier to participation for ordinary users, but also incentivizes validators to actively maintain the security and efficiency of the network.
- **Validator Election**:
  - Each Epoch votes on the network to elect a group of validators, who collectively participate in block validation and consensus.
  - At the end of each epoch, validators are rewarded based on their performance, such as the efficiency and accuracy with which transactions are processed.
- **Decentralization and Flexibility**:
  - The DPoS mechanism combines the advantages of high performance and decentralization, allowing OneChain to balance security and scalability.

### 3.7.2 DAG Consensus Protocol {/* {#section3-7-2} */}

  - **Implicit Confirmation**: The implicit voting mechanism is used to reduce the communication overhead between validators and significantly reduce bandwidth consumption.
  - **Strong Fault Tolerance**: Maintains stable performance even if some validators fail, ensuring continuous transaction confirmation.

## 3.8 Checkpoint {/* {#section3-8} */}

Checkpoint is the key transaction confirmation and recording mechanism in OneChain, which is used to provide finality assurance and ensure that transaction records are immutable in the network.

### 3.8.1 The process by which checkpoints are generated {/* {#section3-8-1} */}
![Checkpoint](https://statics-testnet.onelabs.cc/checkpoint.png "Checkpoint")

- **Transaction Submission**: The user initiates a transaction through the wallet or app, generates a transaction request, signs it, and submits the transaction to Full Node.
- **Transaction Authentication**: Full Node collects at least two-thirds (2/3) of the validators' signatures to form a Transaction Certificate, which is broadcast to all validators.
- **Trade Execution**:
  - Transactions involving exclusive objects: can be executed directly without going through the consensus engine (fast path).
  - Transactions involving shared objects: Ordered via DAG consensus protocol before execution.
- **Transaction Effect Signing**: Post-execution, validators sign transaction effects (e.g., object changes, Gas consumption) and return them to Full Nodes. Full Nodes collect sufficient signatures to generate an Effects Certificate, confirming the transaction.
- **Checkpoint Generation**:
  - The validator obtains an ordered list of transactions from the consensus layer and ensures that the causal relationship between the transactions is intact.
  - The validator assembles the ordered transactions into a checkpoint, which contains a summary of the transaction and a summary of its performance
  - Checkpoints are signed by two-thirds of the validators to become the network's certified checkpoints.
- **Finality Guarantee**: When a transaction is included in a certified checkpoint, the transaction is considered permanent and immutable, reaching finality.

### 3.8.2 Key characteristics of checkpoints {/* {#section3-8-2} */}

- **Global Consistency**: Checkpoint ensures that all validators in the network agree on the order of transactions.
- **Finality**:
  - **Finality n Transaction Certificate**: Transactions are essentially irreversible after authentication, but may become invalid when Epoch switches.
  - **Effects Certificate**: The Effect Certificate further provides a strong guarantee of finality.
  - **Checkpoint**: Once a transaction is included in an authenticated checkpoint, it is immutable and final.
- **Causal Integrity**: Causal relationships are automatically filled in during checkpoint processing, ensuring that all dependencies are complete in the checkpoint.
- **Efficiency**: Checkpoints can be generated and authenticated in just a few seconds, ensuring efficient network operation.

## 3.9 DID: Decentralized Proof of Identity {/* {#section3-9} */}

Redefine user identity and break down on-chain data silos

### 3.9.1 Core Concept{/* {#section3-9-1} */}

In traditional blockchains, user identities are usually identified only by addresses, which cannot reflect real user needs and behaviors. OneChain introduces DID (Decentralized Identity Proof) to elevate users from a single address to a multi-address identity level.

- **Design Highlights**: When each user logs in to the on-chain application, a 13-digit random number DID is automatically generated as a unique identifier for the user.

If the address generated by the user in other applications on the chain is the same, it will be bound to its initial DID to achieve unified ownership of the address.

Based on DID, OneChain can analyze the on-chain behavior of users and help various applications provide more accurate personalized services.

- **Value & Significance**:DIDs allow users to seamlessly use services across applications without having to frequently sign up for new accounts or memorize complex private keys.

DIDs empower application developers to gain a deeper understanding of user needs, improve user experience, and provide new possibilities for business services.

The construction of the DID Alliance will promote more applications to join the OneChain ecosystem and further expand the on-chain network effect.

### 3.9.2 Technical Implementation: 13-Digit DID Number {/* {#section3-9-2} */}

OneChain DID is natively supported by its underlying design. Each user is automatically assigned a unique 13-digit random DID number upon logging into on-chain applications, serving as their sole on-chain identity identifier.

Key characteristics of the DID number:

- **Privacy**: Contains no personal information, protecting user privacy.
- **Scalability**: Supports binding multiple wallet addresses to meet diverse user needs.
- **Self-Management**: Identity data is fully controlled by users, stored on the blockchain, and is tamper-proof and verifiable.

Users can optionally maintain multiple DIDs for different scenarios. Crucially, this process is effortless for users—no complex forms or tedious verifications are required. By logging in via “OAUTH identity,” users automatically receive their DID, gaining an “on-chain ID card” within the OneChain ecosystem.

### 3.9.3 OAUTH Identity Login: The convenience of Web2.0 is perfectly combined with the privacy of Web3.0 {/* {#section3-9-3} */}

OneChain's OAUTH is a zero-knowledge proof login method that enables users to access on-chain apps via Web2 platforms (e.g., Google, Facebook), with deep integration for a seamless experience.

### 3.9.4 Design Highlights {/* {#section3-9-4} */}

- **Convenience**: Users can log in to OneChain using their existing app accounts — no new wallet or mnemonic needed — while zero-knowledge proofs ensure full privacy and anonymity between their Web2 and on-chain identities.
- **Privacy Protection**: Zero-knowledge proofs ensure on-chain identities are anonymously linked to Web2.0 accounts, preventing data leaks.

This design positions OneChain as one of the few systems truly bridging Web2.0 and Web3.0 identities. It upholds decentralization while bringing blockchain closer to mainstream users, injecting vitality into the ecosystem.

### 3.9.5 User Value: Universal ID, Convenient and Secure {/* {#section3-9-5} */}

- **One Identity for All Chains**: No repeated registrations or authorizations—DID enables seamless access across all OneChain DApps, with unified identity and integrated data for a smoother experience.
- **Enhanced Privacy and Security**: DID relies on no centralized servers; all data is user-controlled and stored on-chain, minimizing privacy risks from intermediary platforms.
- **Simplified Wallet Management**: Multiple wallet addresses are linked to a single DID, reducing confusion and account management burdens.

DID acts as an on-chain “passport,” making the Web3.0 journey easier while ensuring asset and identity security.

### 3.9.6 Developer Value: Precise Services and Commercialization {/* {#section3-9-6} */}

OneChain DID empowers developers with robust tools:

- **Complete User Profiles**: A unified identity system aggregates user behavior data across addresses, revealing preferences and activity for personalized features and services.
- **On-Chain Credit Building**: Long-term DID-based behavior data creates user reputation systems, providing a trusted foundation for financial or social interactions.
- **Cross-Platform Data Integration**: DID enables data connectivity across DeFi, NFTs, and more, unlocking greater commercial potential.

### 3.9.7 DID Alliance and Win-Win Ecosystem {/* {#section3-9-7} */}

OneChain DID’s vision extends beyond a single project, aiming to establish a Web3.0 identity standard. To this end, OneChain is launching a DID Alliance, inviting blockchain projects and developer teams to co-build a unified, open, and interoperable on-chain identity ecosystem.

- **Developer Benefits**: Rapid integration of a unified identity system reduces development costs.
- **Ecosystem Prosperity**: More applications increase user value, attracting more projects and creating a virtuous cycle.

This is not just technical collaboration but a win-win practice for decentralized ecosystems.

### 3.9.8 Real-World Applications: DID in DeFi and NFTs {/* {#section3-9-8} */}

- **📈 In DeFi**: Users leverage DID to participate in lending, trading, and yield farming without repeated authorizations or wallet connections. Unified identities also build on-chain credit, unlocking premium financial services.
- **🎨 In NFTs**: Artists bind DIDs to their works, enhancing authenticity and authority. Collectors’ DIDs record transaction and collection histories, building unique on-chain reputation assets, significantly boosting NFT market trust and transparency.

DID empowers true ownership of on-chain identities. OneChain DID eliminates identity fragmentation, disjointed experiences, and trust gaps, marking a major leap in Web3.0 user experience.

## 3.10 Zero Gas: OneChain Redefines the Web3.0 User Experience {/* {#section3-10} */}

Zero Gas is not just a technical optimization for OneChain; it’s a core part of our ecosystem vision. We aim to build a blockchain system that prioritizes both high performance and high availability, where user experience isn’t a sacrifice but a central value.

In the decentralized world of Web3.0, GAS fees have always been an unavoidable topic. They are the “invisible ticket” for every on-chain operation — seemingly reasonable, yet a real barrier to entry for ordinary users.
Just downloaded a wallet, but couldn’t send a transaction due to lack of GAS; wanted to try NFTs, but got stuck at “please top up GAS fees”; despite being next-gen tech, you were discouraged by GAS fees?

Have you ever had a Web3.0 first experience like this?

Just downloaded a wallet, but couldn’t send a transaction due to lack of GAS; wanted to try NFTs, but got stuck at “please top up GAS fees”; despite being next-gen tech, you were discouraged by GAS fees?

At OneChain, we believe: true Web3.0 shouldn’t have barriers. That’s why we’re officially launching the Zero GAS Mechanism, enabling every user to access blockchain applications without thresholds, making GAS invisible to users.

### 3.10.1 💡Core Philosophy: GAS is a technical barrier, not a user barrier {/* {#section3-10-1} */}
GAS exists to prevent spam transactions and incentivize network operation. But for most non-technical users, the GAS model is unfamiliar and complex:

- Don’t understand why they need to buy a “token” to operate, and don’t want to learn.
- Can’t figure out how much GAS is left in the wallet or if a transaction is possible.
- Every top-up feels like “prepaying a phone bill,” unsure if it’ll be used up.
- Using on-chain services feels more complicated than Web2.0.
- Frequent top-ups, conversions, lags, and failures… a terrible experience.

Every interaction feels like a hurdle, and for Web2.0 users, this is a “turn-off”. This not only limits Web3.0 usage frequency but also hinders its real-world adoption. **We believe great technology shouldn’t rely on users understanding tech.**

### 3.10.2 Design Highlights {/* {#section3-10-2} */}
By integrating the Gas Sponsorship SDK, on-chain applications can implement delegated gas payments, delivering a smoother and more seamless user experience on the blockchain.
OneChain introduces an innovative Delegated Payment Mechanism, enabling GAS-free operations for users:

The application integrates via the Gas Sponsorship SDK, users can perform on-chain operations without holding any tokens. GAS fees are covered by the application system, so users can focus on usage without paying for complex on-chain processes.

This design is especially suited for high-frequency scenarios:

- 🪙 Payments/Transfers: No “you’re short 0.002 GAS” reminders — one-click completion.
- 🌍 Cross-Border Settlements: High-frequency trades without GAS fee explosions.
- 🖼 NFT Trading: As smooth as ordering on an e-commerce platform.
- 💼 Enterprise Applications: Large-scale user onboarding no longer limited by GAS.
- 🎮 GameFi Interactions: Zero GAS for truly seamless gaming experiences.
- 🧩 Daily dApp Usage: From wallet to payments, completely frictionless.

### 3.10.3 Scenario1: How OneChain Makes Blockchain “Invisible” in User Experience {/* {#section3-10-3} */}

**Scenario 1: 🎮 Playing a Traditional On Chain Game (e.g., Ethereum/Polygon)**

- Download MetaMask wallet
- Swap existing assets for ETH
- Top up ETH to MetaMask from another wallet
- Open the On chain game

- Run out of ETH mid-game?🙃Repeat steps 1–5…

😩User experience? Constant interruptions.

**🎮Playing a OneChain-Based Chain Game**

- Open the One-chain game
- Connect OneChain wallet
- Start playing seamlessly

😄On-chain operations are invisible, no GAS interruptions, no operational hassles — a smooth, uninterrupted experience!

✨Blockchain shouldn’t be a front-stage Star; it should be like internet, quietly supporting the user experience in the background.

### 3.10.4 Scenario 2: 🧩Daily dApp Usage {/* {#section3-10-4} */}
Common pain points for regular users in Web3.0 dApps:

- Tedious registration with mnemonic phrases.
- Frequent pop-ups for “confirm payment” or “insufficient GAS.”

## 4.3 OneRWA: The On-Chain Gateway to Real-World Asset Infrastructure {/* {#section4-3} */}
OneChain believes that true blockchain financial infrastructure must bridge the gap between value and price. We are collaborating with ecosystem partners to build a structured asset investment platform, enabling real value to flow on-chain with robust price discovery capabilities.

### 4.3.1 Current Dilemma: Web3.0 Lacks Assets, Web2.0 Lacks Innovation {/* {#section4-3-1} */}

![RWA](https://statics-testnet.onelabs.cc/rwa_en.png "RWA")

#### Web3.0: Robust Financial Infrastructure, Lacking Quality Underlying Assets
Traditional crypto assets like BTC and ETH struggle to meet the demands of higher-tier asset investments. Despite having a “price”, most lack ties to real-world value systems, with no stable revenue models or asset backing.

#### Web2.0: Abundant Real-World Assets, Lacking Liquidity and Financial Innovation
Premium real-world assets (e.g., real estate, supply chain receivables, commercial paper) offer predictable cash flows and stable value but are hindered by intermediaries, regional restrictions, and trust costs, making issuance, circulation, and investment inefficient.

#### Result: 
Enterprises struggle with efficient financing, everyday users are excluded from value accretion of premium assets, and on-chain ecosystems lack the infusion of real-world assets.

#### OneChain Focuses on Three Pain Points
- **Web3.0**: Singular asset structures lacking real-world backing.
- **Web2.0**: High securitization costs, poor liquidity, and opaque processes.
- **Ordinary Users**: High entry barriers, unable to participate in premium asset allocation.

OneChain believes that true blockchain financial infrastructure must bridge the gap between value and price. We are collaborating with ecosystem partners to build a structured asset investment platform, enabling real value to flow on-chain with robust price discovery capabilities.

### 4.3.2 OneRWA: A Platform Connecting Real-World Assets to Web3.0 {/* {#section4-3-2} */}

#### Bridging Web2.0 and Web3.0, Reshaping the Asset Circulation Value Chain
OneChain is constructing a conduit between real-world assets and on-chain finance — a platform supporting asset tokenization, smart dividend distribution, structured investments, and global circulation. In collaboration with ecosystem partners, we aim to create an asset infrastructure with the following features
#### OneRWA is OneChain’s on-chain structured asset platform, encompassing the full lifecycle of asset issuance, investment, dividends, and trading, blending traditional financial logic with blockchain infrastructure
- **Bridging Two Worlds**: Real-world assets + Web3.0 assets.
- **Three-Tier Value Flow**: Data on-chain, revenue on-chain, assets on-chain.
- **Regulatory and Decentralized Fusion**:  Compliance audits + smart contracts + decentralized trading.
- **Multi-Party Participation**: Issuers, banks, funds, insurers, and custodians can all integrate.

### 4.3.3 Core Capabilities {/* {#section4-3-3} */}

#### Diverse Asset Tokenization and Issuance:

Supports tokenization of various real-world assets, including but not limited to::

- **Financial Assets**: Bills, receivables, leases, revenue rights, etc.
- **Commercial Real Estate**: Office buildings, industrial parks, long-term rental properties, etc.
- **Supply Chain Assets**: Accounts receivable, order financing, prepayment agreements, etc.

Through standardized digital processes, traditional assets gain composable, circulatable, and traceable on-chain forms, enhancing financing and investment efficiency.

#### Revenue Dividend Mechanism:
Using on-chain smart contracts, asset revenue is automatically distributed without reliance on intermediaries. Users can invest via their wallets, with the platform allocating profits proportionally. The process is fully transparent, tamper-proof, and realizes “revenue on-chain, dividends visible”

#### Structured Investment Tools:
OneChain introduces a structured asset design framework, offering customizable asset portfolio strategies:

- Multi-asset bundling for risk diversification.
- Categorization by risk appetite, maturity, and revenue type.
- Support for fixed, floating, or hybrid product structures.

Users can freely configure portfolios on the platform, lowering entry barriers while enhancing visibility and flexibility in asset management.

#### Structured Financial Derivatives:
By designing leveraged products, tiered revenue structures, and perpetual swaps, we unlock the latent liquidity of premium assets and offer innovative on-chain wealth management products to meet diverse user needs. These products provide higher yield potential for asset holders while attracting broader on-chain capital participation.

### 4.3.4 Real-World Use Cases: Solving Practical Challenges for Enterprises and Users{/* {#section4-3-4} */}

#### Commercial Real Estate Financing on Chain:
- **The Problem**:

Traditional real estate financing is plagued by lengthy processes, high intermediary costs, and fragmented systems involving title transfers, escrow, and payments. Lack of transparency and accessibility further restricts investment and capital efficiency.

- **OneChain Solutions**:
Tokenizing Real Estate Through Structured On-Chain Financing:
    - **Enhanced Asset Liquidity**:
      - By tokenizing real estate into fractionalized, tradable digital assets, OneChain breaks the illiquidity of high-value properties, enabling seamless secondary market transactions and more flexible exits.
    - **Lower Investment Thresholds, Broader Access**:
      - Through fractional ownership, large-scale properties are divided into standardized units, allowing retail investors to participate with minimal capital — democratizing access to premium real estate markets.
    - **Smart Contract Automation for Cost & Risk Reduction**:
      - Core transaction processes — including rent distribution, ownership transfer, and settlement — are executed via smart contracts, eliminating intermediaries, improving efficiency, and ensuring tamper-proof transparency
    - **Composability with DeFi: Unlocking Additional Yield**:
      - TTokenized properties can be used beyond passive holding — serving as collateral or liquidity assets in DeFi protocols. This enables dual-income potential: rental yield + on-chain financial returns.

#### Supply Chain Finance On-Chain:
- **The Problem**:
SMEs often face high financing costs, slow approvals, and opaque repayment cycles. Meanwhile, financial institutions lack clear visibility into asset risk and creditworthiness.

- **OneChain Solutions**:
    - On-Chain Asset Verification for Transparency:
    - **Core Asset Attestation for Transparency**:
      - Key documents such as invoices, contracts, and receivables are anchored on-chain, supporting third-party verification and auditability, thereby increasing trust in underlying asset quality.
    - **Ecosystem Integration for Capital Efficiency**:
      - All cash flows — from receivables to repayments — are automatically executed and distributed, minimizing manual intervention and reducing operational risk.
    - **Ecosystem Resource Integration for Broader Financing**:
      - By connecting Web3 liquidity, DeFi protocols, and enterprise partners, OneChain offers a unified financial infrastructure that bridges traditional supply chain assets with blockchain-native capital, driving more efficient financing cycles.

### 4.3.5 RWA Structured Innovation: Enabling On-Chain Asset Composability, Pricing, and Tradability {/* {#section4-3-5} */}

#### OneRWA goes beyond tokenizing assets — it redefines financial product design logic.
Over the past decade, Web3.0’s rapid growth made “asset tokenization” a consensus. However, RWA practices remain rudimentary: valuable but lacking price formation mechanisms, product innovation, and market depth.

OneChain and its ecosystem partners are advancing the next phase of RWA innovation: building a structured asset issuance and circulation platform. Through principal-revenue separation, risk tiering, perpetual trading, and insurance mechanisms, we inject real financial logic into on-chain assets.

- **Innovation 1: Principal-Revenue Separation (RWAPT / RWAST)**:
  - Principal-Interest Split is a classic structured design in traditional finance, common in fixed-income securities and ABS. We replicate and optimize this on-chain::
    - **RWAPT (RWA Principal Token)**: Represents principal, starting at $95, appreciating daily, redeemable at $100 after one year.
    - **RWAST (RWA Strip Token)**: Represents yield rights, starting at $20, decreasing daily to near $0 after 365 days, but continuously earning dividends or interest.
    - **Value Logic**:
      - RWAPT suits conservative investors, locking in principal returns.
      - RWAST suits high-yield seekers, accepting volatility for higher dividends.
- **Innovation 2: On-Chain Leverage Trading and Risk Hedging Tools**:
  - Combined with OneChain’s perpetual contract module, RWA products support:
    - Up to 20x decentralized leverage to amplify returns or hedge RWAST market volatility risks.
    - Yield enhancement/risk management strategy combinations using RWA + derivatives for differentiated strategy options.
  - Transforms RWAs from “on-chain bonds” to a “market for on-chain asset portfolio trading.”

- **Innovation 3: Asset Aggregation + Risk-Tiered Issuance**:
  - Builds an RWA aggregated issuance model to cater to diverse investment preferences and risk tolerances:
    | Asset Pool | Initial Price | Expected Yield |
    |------------|---------------|----------------|
    | RWAT1      | $0.90         | 10% annualized (senior) |
    | RWAT2      | $0.80         | 20% annualized (mezzanine) |
    | RWAT3      | $0.70         | 30% annualized (junior) |
  - **Tiered Yields**:
    - First-tier investors: 10% excess incentives.
    - Second-tier investors: 15% incentives.
    - Third-tier investors: 20% incentives + risk commitment mechanisms.
  - Mirrors real-world “CDO/CLO” structures, allowing users to select risk-yield preferences.

- **Innovation 4: On-Chain Insurance and Decentralized Funding Pools**:
  - Introduces decentralized insurance to address “credit backing” gaps in on-chain real assets:
    - **RWA Insurance Pool**: Users can stake funds to provide price stability and credit compensation for tokenized assets.
    - **Win-Win Model**: Insurers earn premium revenue; investors gain risk protection.
    - **Transparent On-Chain Assurance**: All policies, claims, and fund flows are recorded on-chain with automated triggers and community governance.
This significantly boosts the appeal and trust of structured assets for traditional institutions and retail users.

#### Making Real Value “Visible, Investable, and Divisible” On-Chain

RWAs are the key to bridging blockchain finance with the real economy. Transformative RWAs require structured design, liquidity, pricing mechanisms, and yield management.

**OneChain’s Goal**: This is the goal OneChain and its partners are pursuing: building a structured asset platform with diverse underlying assets, transparent governance, and clear revenue visibility, serving the next generation of Web3.0 investors and enterprise asset managers.

Web3.0 should not be limited to “coins” — it must carry real value. On the path to WallStreet 3.0, connecting real value with on-chain price discovery will be the most disruptive revolution. OneChain standardizes, modularizes, and intelligentizes asset securitization through structured approaches, turning every premium asset into an “investable product” and providing every user with access to the on-chain financial system.
