# 1. Background {/* {#section1} */}

In an era of rapid digital economy development, blockchain technology is redefining trust and collaboration. However, despite many platforms excelling in technical performance, their ecosystems are limited by a lack of practical application scenarios. The world needs a **high-performance, user-friendly, and cost-effective** blockchain platform to provide groundbreaking solutions for real-world applications (Web2).

![ONECHAIN WALLSTREET 3.0](https://statics-testnet.onelabs.cc/wallstreet_en.png "Wallstreet")

Over the past 150 years, the global financial system has evolved from bank-dominated capital markets through the industrial revolution, information revolution, and now the digital finance era. By the late 19th century, modern banking systems took shape, with central banks controlling money supply and commercial banks managing capital flows, accelerating global financial market formation. In the 20th century, stock exchanges, credit systems, and electronic payment systems emerged, making financial markets more complex and efficient. However, the 2008 financial crisis exposed vulnerabilities in the traditional banking system, with excessive leverage and opaque financial transactions leading to global economic turmoil. People began questioning the stability of centralized financial systems and seeking new financial models. In 2009, Bitcoin's emergence marked the start of the decentralized finance era. Bitcoin offered a global payment method independent of banks, while Ethereum’s smart contracts enabled blockchain-based financial applications. Decentralized finance (DeFi) grew rapidly, allowing lending, trading, and payments to operate directly on the blockchain without banks or financial institutions.

This transformation is ushering in a new era of global finance—Wall Street 3.0.

## 1.1 Wall Street 1.0: The Rise and Fall of Traditional Banking Systems {/* {#section1-1} */}

For over a century, the global financial system has been dominated by banks, with central banks setting monetary policies and commercial banks providing loans, payments, and investment services. Financial markets were regulated by governments to ensure stability and credit system operations. While this system drove global economic growth, it had significant drawbacks.

First, the banking system is highly centralized, with financial resources and power concentrated in the hands of a few financial giants. Ordinary users’ assets are held by banks, preventing true control over their wealth. Second, transaction costs are high, with banks charging substantial fees as intermediaries, especially for cross-border payments, which are complex and expensive. Additionally, transactions are slow, with cross-border settlements often taking days due to reliance on traditional clearing and approval processes.

More critically, billions of people worldwide remain unbanked, excluded from modern financial systems. The flaws of traditional banking—lack of transparency, inefficiency, and limited access—prevent ordinary people from accessing quality financial services.

## 1.2 Wall Street 2.0: The Rise and Limitations of Fintech {/* {#section1-2} */}

In the 21st century, the internet and mobile technology spurred the rise of financial technology (Fintech), making financial services more digital and convenient. Online payment tools like Alipay, PayPal, and Stripe made transfers and payments more efficient. Mobile banking, robo-advisors, and algorithmic trading enabled users to manage wealth anytime, anywhere.

However, despite improving transaction efficiency, Fintech did not fundamentally change the financial system. Fintech companies remain subject to traditional banking regulations and rely on banks for clearing and asset storage. Moreover, financial markets remain highly fragmented, with users’ assets managed independently across platforms, lacking interoperability. For example, stocks invested via Robinhood cannot be directly transferred to another platform, and bank deposits cannot be seamlessly used for crypto investments. This fragmented system restricts the free flow of funds and users’ control over their assets.

Additionally, entering the Fintech market remains challenging due to banking licenses and regulatory constraints, making it difficult for startups to challenge the core dominance of traditional banks. Thus, while Fintech has made financial services more convenient, it has not addressed the core limitations of centralized financial systems.

## 1.3 Wall Street 3.0: Decentralized Finance and the Public Chain Revolution {/* {#section1-3} */}

Today, the financial world is entering the Wall Street 3.0 era, with blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi) forming the core of a new financial system. Unlike traditional finance, DeFi eliminates reliance on banks, using smart contracts and blockchain to enable users to freely store, trade, and lend assets without intermediaries. DeFi is breaking the banking monopoly, making financial transactions more transparent and efficient, and giving users true control over their assets. Despite challenges in regulation, market maturity, and compliance, the growth of blockchain finance is unstoppable. As more traditional financial institutions enter the crypto market, the integration of crypto and traditional finance will accelerate, moving the global financial system toward a more equitable and open future.

Blockchain finance’s greatest strengths are fairness, transparency, low cost, real-time processing, and 24/7 availability. All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, publicly verifiable, and tamper-proof, significantly enhancing trust in the financial system. Users can freely transfer assets between DeFi protocols, with transaction settlements completed in seconds—far faster than traditional banking’s multi-day processes. Anyone, anywhere, can create, own, and trade assets, granting individuals greater control and realizing the true value of the internet. Blockchain benefits people, not platforms, eliminating untrustworthy intermediaries and protecting privacy. Direct digital ownership empowers everyone, enabling the internet’s full potential. DeFi is dismantling banking monopolies, making transactions more transparent and efficient, and giving users true asset control. Despite regulatory and maturity challenges, blockchain finance’s growth is irreversible. As traditional institutions embrace this shift, crypto finance is becoming a key component of the global financial system, enabling seamless cross-border payments and value storage. With increasing institutional capital inflows, crypto finance is gradually becoming integral to global finance.

## 3.9 DID: Decentralized Identity Proof {/* {#section3-9} */}

On-chain identity should not merely be an address but a unified, trusted multi-address identity system.

### 3.9.1 Core Concept: Multiple Addresses, One Identity {/* {#section3-9-1} */}

In traditional blockchain models, each wallet address is treated as a separate identity. However, users often hold multiple addresses, which remain disconnected, fragmenting identity information. For example, a user might use one wallet address for Protocol A and another for Application B, with no on-chain linkage between the two.

This fragmented identity causes several issues:

- **User Experience**: Frequent account switching or repeated authorizations hinder usability.
- **Developer Challenges**: Inability to accurately identify real users limits personalized services.

OneChain DID aims to resolve this fragmentation by providing each user with a unified identity across all on-chain activities. Regardless of how many addresses a user has in the OneChain ecosystem, they all link to a single DID. This creates a true “on-chain ID card,” consolidating a user’s behaviors, assets, and records under one identity.

### 3.9.2 Technical Implementation: 13-Digit DID Number {/* {#section3-9-2} */}

OneChain DID is natively supported by its underlying design. Each user is automatically assigned a unique 13-digit random DID number upon logging into on-chain applications, serving as their sole on-chain identity identifier.

Key characteristics of the DID number:

- **Privacy**: Contains no personal information, protecting user privacy.
- **Scalability**: Supports binding multiple wallet addresses to meet diverse user needs.
- **Self-Management**: Identity data is fully controlled by users, stored on the blockchain, and is tamper-proof and verifiable.

Users can optionally maintain multiple DIDs for different scenarios. Crucially, this process is effortless for users—no complex forms or tedious verifications are required. By logging in via “OAUTH identity,” users automatically receive their DID, gaining an “on-chain ID card” within the OneChain ecosystem.

### 3.9.3 OAUTH Identity Login: Web2.0 Convenience + Web3.0 Privacy {/* {#section3-9-3} */}

OneChain innovatively introduces an OAUTH login mechanism, enabling traditional internet users to access on-chain identities seamlessly.

This zero-knowledge proof-based on-chain authentication allows users to log into OneChain ecosystem applications using Web2.0 accounts (e.g., Google, Facebook), accessing on-chain services. Through deep integration with login apps, OneChain optimizes this technology for a seamless login experience.

### 3.9.4 Design Highlights {/* {#section3-9-4} */}

- **Convenience**: Users log in with existing app accounts, no new wallets or mnemonic phrases required.
- **Privacy Protection**: Zero-knowledge proofs ensure on-chain identities are anonymously linked to Web2.0 accounts, preventing data leaks.

This design positions OneChain as one of the few systems truly bridging Web2.0 and Web3.0 identities. It upholds decentralization while bringing blockchain closer to mainstream users, injecting vitality into the ecosystem.

### 3.9.5 User Value: Universal ID, Convenient and Secure {/* {#section3-9-5} */}

- **One Identity for All Chains**: No repeated registrations or authorizations—DID enables seamless access across all OneChain DApps, with unified identity and integrated data for a smoother experience.
- **Enhanced Privacy and Security**: DID relies on no centralized servers; all data is user-controlled and stored on-chain, minimizing privacy risks from intermediary platforms.
- **Simplified Wallet Management**: Multiple wallet addresses are linked to a single DID, reducing confusion and account management burdens.

DID acts as an on-chain “passport,” making the Web3.0 journey easier while ensuring asset and identity security.

### 3.9.6 Developer Value: Precise Services and Commercialization {/* {#section3-9-6} */}

OneChain DID empowers developers with robust tools:

- **Complete User Profiles**: A unified identity system aggregates user behavior data across addresses, revealing preferences and activity for personalized features and services.
- **On-Chain Credit Building**: Long-term DID-based behavior data creates user reputation systems, providing a trusted foundation for financial or social interactions.
- **Cross-Platform Data Integration**: DID enables data connectivity across DeFi, NFTs, and more, unlocking greater commercial potential.

### 3.9.7 DID Alliance and Win-Win Ecosystem {/* {#section3-9-7} */}

OneChain DID’s vision extends beyond a single project, aiming to establish a Web3.0 identity standard. To this end, OneChain is launching a DID Alliance, inviting blockchain projects and developer teams to co-build a unified, open, and interoperable on-chain identity ecosystem.

- **Developer Benefits**: Rapid integration of a unified identity system reduces development costs.
- **Ecosystem Prosperity**: More applications increase user value, attracting more projects and creating a virtuous cycle.

This is not just technical collaboration but a win-win practice for decentralized ecosystems.

### 3.9.8 Real-World Applications: DID in DeFi and NFTs {/* {#section3-9-8} */}

- **📈 In DeFi**: Users leverage DID to participate in lending, trading, and yield farming without repeated authorizations or wallet connections. Unified identities also build on-chain credit, unlocking premium financial services.
- **🎨 In NFTs**: Artists bind DIDs to their works, enhancing authenticity and authority. Collectors’ DIDs record transaction and collection histories, building unique on-chain reputation assets, significantly boosting NFT market trust and transparency.

### 4.3.1 RWA {/* {#section4-3-1} */}

#### Web3.0: Robust Financial Infrastructure, Lacking Quality Underlying Assets
- Traditional crypto assets (e.g., BTC, ETH) struggle to meet advanced investment needs.
- They have “prices” but lack ties to real-world value systems, missing stable yield models or asset backing.

#### Web2.0: Abundant Real-World Assets, Lacking Liquidity and Innovation
- Quality assets (e.g., real estate, supply chain receivables, commercial papers) offer stable value and cash flows.
- However, intermediaries, regional restrictions, and trust costs hinder issuance, circulation, and investment.

#### Results:
- Low corporate financing efficiency.
- Ordinary users cannot participate in quality asset appreciation.
- On-chain ecosystems lack real asset integration.

#### OneChain’s Focus: Three Key Pain Points
- **Web3.0**: Singular asset structures lacking real-world backing.

### 4.3.5 RWA Structural Innovations: Enabling “Composition,” “Pricing,” and “Tradability” for Real Assets {/* {#section4-3-5} */}

#### OneRWA goes beyond on-chain assets, redefining financial product design logic.

- **Innovation 1: Principal-Yield Separation (RWAPT / RWAST)**:
  - Replicates and optimizes traditional finance’s principal-yield separation:
    - **RWAPT (RWA Principal Token)**: Represents principal, starting at $95, appreciating daily, redeemable at $100 after one year.
    - **RWAST (RWA Strip Token)**: Represents yield rights, starting at $20, decreasing daily to near $0 after 365 days, but continuously earning dividends or interest.
    - **Value Logic**:
      - RWAPT suits conservative investors, locking in principal returns.
      - RWAST suits high-yield seekers, accepting volatility for higher dividends.
- **Innovation 2: On-Chain Leverage Trading and Risk Hedging Tools**:
  - Combined with OneChain’s perpetual contract module, RWA products support:
    - Up to 20x decentralized leverage to amplify returns or hedge RWAST market volatility risks.
    - Yield enhancement/risk management strategy combinations using RWA + derivatives for differentiated strategy options.
  - Transforms RWAs from “on-chain bonds” to a “market for on-chain asset portfolio trading.”
- **Innovation 3: Asset Aggregation + Risk-Tiered Issuance**:
  - Builds an RWA aggregated issuance model to cater to diverse investment preferences and risk tolerances:
    | Asset Pool | Initial Price | Expected Yield |
    |------------|---------------|----------------|
    | RWAT1      | $0.90         | 10% annualized (senior) |
    | RWAT2      | $0.80         | 20% annualized (mezzanine) |
    | RWAT3      | $0.70         | 30% annualized (junior) |
  - **Tiered Yields**:
    - First-tier investors: 10% excess incentives.
    - Second-tier investors: 15% incentives.
    - Third-tier investors: 20% incentives + risk commitment mechanisms.
  - Mirrors real-world “CDO/CLO” structures, allowing users to select risk-yield preferences.
- **Innovation 4: On-Chain Insurance and Decentralized Funding Pools**:
  - Introduces decentralized insurance to address “credit backing” gaps in on-chain real assets:
    - **RWA Insurance Pool**: Users stake funds to provide price stability/credit compensation for tokenized assets.
    - **Insurer-Investor Win-Win Model**: Insurers earn premium yields; investors gain risk hedging protection.
    - **Transparent On-Chain Assurance**: Policies, claims, and fund flows are recorded on-chain with automated triggers and community governance.

**Making Real Value “Visible, Investable, and Divisible” On-Chain**

RWAs are the key to bridging blockchain finance with the real economy. Transformative RWAs require structured design, liquidity, pricing mechanisms, and yield management.

**OneChain’s Goal**:  
Build a structured asset platform with rich underlying assets, transparent governance, and clear yield visibility, serving next-generation Web3.0 investors and corporate asset managers. Web3.0 shouldn’t just be about “coins” but should carry real value.
