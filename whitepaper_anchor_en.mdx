# 1. Background {/* {#section1} */}

In an era of rapid digital economy development, blockchain technology is redefining trust and collaboration. However, despite many platforms excelling in technical performance, their ecosystems are limited by a lack of practical application scenarios. The world needs a **high-performance, user-friendly, and cost-effective** blockchain platform to provide groundbreaking solutions for real-world applications (Web2).

![ONECHAIN WALLSTREET 3.0](./image/wallstreet.png "Wallstreet")

Over the past 150 years, the global financial system has evolved from bank-dominated capital markets through the industrial revolution, information revolution, and now the digital finance era. By the late 19th century, modern banking systems took shape, with central banks controlling money supply and commercial banks managing capital flows, accelerating global financial market formation. In the 20th century, stock exchanges, credit systems, and electronic payment systems emerged, making financial markets more complex and efficient. However, the 2008 financial crisis exposed vulnerabilities in the traditional banking system, with excessive leverage and opaque financial transactions leading to global economic turmoil. People began questioning the stability of centralized financial systems and seeking new financial models. In 2009, Bitcoin's emergence marked the start of the decentralized finance era. Bitcoin offered a global payment method independent of banks, while Ethereum’s smart contracts enabled blockchain-based financial applications. Decentralized finance (DeFi) grew rapidly, allowing lending, trading, and payments to operate directly on the blockchain without banks or financial institutions.

This transformation is ushering in a new era of global finance—Wall Street 3.0.

## 1.1 Wall Street 1.0: The Rise and Fall of Traditional Banking Systems {/* {#section1-1} */}

For over a century, the global financial system has been dominated by banks, with central banks setting monetary policies and commercial banks providing loans, payments, and investment services. Financial markets were regulated by governments to ensure stability and credit system operations. While this system drove global economic growth, it had significant drawbacks.

First, the banking system is highly centralized, with financial resources and power concentrated in the hands of a few financial giants. Ordinary users’ assets are held by banks, preventing true control over their wealth. Second, transaction costs are high, with banks charging substantial fees as intermediaries, especially for cross-border payments, which are complex and expensive. Additionally, transactions are slow, with cross-border settlements often taking days due to reliance on traditional clearing and approval processes.

More critically, billions of people worldwide remain unbanked, excluded from modern financial systems. The flaws of traditional banking—lack of transparency, inefficiency, and limited access—prevent ordinary people from accessing quality financial services.

## 1.2 Wall Street 2.0: The Rise and Limitations of Fintech {/* {#section1-2} */}

In the 21st century, the internet and mobile technology spurred the rise of financial technology (Fintech), making financial services more digital and convenient. Online payment tools like Alipay, PayPal, and Stripe made transfers and payments more efficient. Mobile banking, robo-advisors, and algorithmic trading enabled users to manage wealth anytime, anywhere.

However, despite improving transaction efficiency, Fintech did not fundamentally change the financial system. Fintech companies remain subject to traditional banking regulations and rely on banks for clearing and asset storage. Moreover, financial markets remain highly fragmented, with users’ assets managed independently across platforms, lacking interoperability. For example, stocks invested via Robinhood cannot be directly transferred to another platform, and bank deposits cannot be seamlessly used for crypto investments. This fragmented system restricts the free flow of funds and users’ control over their assets.

Additionally, entering the Fintech market remains challenging due to banking licenses and regulatory constraints, making it difficult for startups to challenge the core dominance of traditional banks. Thus, while Fintech has made financial services more convenient, it has not addressed the core limitations of centralized financial systems.

## 1.3 Wall Street 3.0: Decentralized Finance and the Public Chain Revolution {/* {#section1-3} */}

Today, the financial world is entering the Wall Street 3.0 era, with blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi) forming the core of a new financial system. Unlike traditional finance, DeFi eliminates reliance on banks, using smart contracts and blockchain to enable users to freely store, trade, and lend assets without intermediaries. DeFi is breaking the banking monopoly, making financial transactions more transparent and efficient, and giving users true control over their assets. Despite challenges in regulation, market maturity, and compliance, the growth of blockchain finance is unstoppable. As more traditional financial institutions enter the crypto market, the integration of crypto and traditional finance will accelerate, moving the global financial system toward a more equitable and open future.

Blockchain finance’s greatest strengths are fairness, transparency, low cost, real-time processing, and 24/7 availability. All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, publicly verifiable, and tamper-proof, significantly enhancing trust in the financial system. Users can freely transfer assets between DeFi protocols, with transaction settlements completed in seconds—far faster than traditional banking’s multi-day processes. Anyone, anywhere, can create, own, and trade assets, granting individuals greater control and realizing the true value of the internet. Blockchain benefits people, not platforms, eliminating untrustworthy intermediaries and protecting privacy. Direct digital ownership empowers everyone, enabling the internet’s full potential. DeFi is dismantling banking monopolies, making transactions more transparent and efficient, and giving users true asset control. Despite regulatory and maturity challenges, blockchain finance’s growth is irreversible. As traditional institutions embrace this shift, crypto finance is becoming a key component of the global financial system, enabling seamless cross-border payments and value storage. With increasing institutional capital inflows, crypto finance is gradually becoming integral to global finance.

## 3.9 DID: Decentralized Identity Proof {/* {#section3-9} */}

On-chain identity should not be just an address but a unified, trusted multi-address identity system.

### 3.9.1 Core Concept: Multiple Addresses, One Identity {/* {#section3-9-1} */}
In traditional blockchain models, each wallet address is treated as a separate identity. However, users often own multiple addresses, which are disconnected, leading to fragmented identity data. For example, you might use one wallet address in Protocol A and another in Application B, with no on-chain linkage between them.

This fragmentation causes issues:
- **User Experience**: Frequent account switching or re-authorizations are cumbersome.
- **Developer Challenges**: Inability to accurately identify users hinders personalized services.

OneChain DID aims to resolve this by providing a unified identity across all on-chain activities. Regardless of how many addresses you use in the OneChain ecosystem, they all link to a single DID, giving you a true “on-chain ID card” that consolidates your behaviors, assets, and records.

### 3.9.2 Technical Implementation: 13-Digit DID Number {/* {#section3-9-2} */}
OneChain DID leverages native support in its underlying design. Each user is automatically assigned a unique 13-digit random DID number upon logging into on-chain applications, serving as their sole on-chain identity identifier.

Key characteristics of the DID number:
- **Privacy**: Contains no personal information, protecting user privacy.
- **Scalability**: Supports binding multiple wallet addresses to meet diverse needs.
- **Self-Management**: Identity data is fully user-controlled, stored on the blockchain, and tamper-proof with verifiability.

Users can optionally maintain multiple DIDs for different scenarios. Crucially, this process is effortless—users don’t need to fill out complex forms or undergo tedious verifications. Logging in via “OAUTH Identity Login” automatically grants a DID, providing an “on-chain ID card” within the OneChain ecosystem.

### 3.9.3 OAUTH Identity Login: Web2.0 Convenience + Web3.0 Privacy {/* {#section3-9-3} */}

Deep integration with login apps further optimizes this experience.

### 3.9.4 Design Highlights {/* {#section3-9-4} */}
- **Convenience**: No need to create new wallets or memorize mnemonic phrases; users log in with existing app accounts.
- **Privacy Protection**: Zero-knowledge proofs ensure anonymity between on-chain identities and Web2.0 accounts, preventing data leaks.

This design makes OneChain one of the few systems bridging Web2.0 and Web3.0 identities, maintaining decentralization while making blockchain more accessible, injecting vitality into the ecosystem.

### 3.9.5 User Value: One ID, Universal, Convenient, and Secure {/* {#section3-9-5} */}
- **Single Identity Across Chains**: No need for repeated registrations or authorizations; a DID grants access to all OneChain DApps, ensuring a seamless experience.
- **Enhanced Privacy and Security**: DIDs are not reliant on centralized servers, with data user-controlled and stored on-chain, minimizing privacy risks.
- **Simplified Wallet Management**: Multiple wallet addresses are linked to one DID, reducing confusion and management burdens.

  - **Tiered Returns**:
    - First-tier investors: 10% excess incentive.
    - Second-tier investors: 15% incentive.
    - Third-tier investors: 20% incentive + risk commitment.
  - Mimics real-world “CDO/CLO” structures, allowing users to choose risk-return preferences.
- **Innovation 4: On-Chain Insurance and Decentralized Fund Pools**:
  - Introduces decentralized insurance to address trust gaps in on-chain real assets:
    - **RWA Insurance Fund Pool**: Users stake funds to provide price stability/credit compensation for tokenized assets.
