# Node Strategy 

#### OneChain is committed to building an open and win-win blockchain ecosystem, bringing together outstanding partners from around the world through the introduction of node co-creation programs to jointly promote the popularization and application of blockchain technology.
#### Enterprises use 0neChain technology to achieve resource integration, data sharing, and efficient collaboration, a simple and easy-to-use platform.

- **Open SDK and Tool Support**:  
  OneChain developers and enterprises provide friendly development tools to quickly build customized blockchain applications.

- **A decentralised network of trust**:  
  Through OneChain's decentralised architecture, enterprises can securely share data and resources and improve the efficiency of cross-industry collaboration.

- **Node Staking Mechanism**:  
  The node staking mechanism ensures that the interests of investors and the platform are bound and jointly promote the development of the ecosystem.

## 1. Organizational nodes - ecological networks {/* {#section1} */}

- **Definition**:  Organisational nodes for proxy partners, provide operational support for the ecological network, and promote the connection and interaction between users and nodes.
- **Entry Conditions**: A certain amount of USDO needs to be staked.
- **Applicable partners**: Mainly service providers and institutions with strong resource integration capabilities.

  - Application acquisition and performance: Applications with over 10,000 downloads by existing users.
  -App Activity: 1,000+ daily active users
  - Community Engagement: User feedback, bug reports, governance participation
- **Node Incentives**:
  - **Periodic Rewards**: Nodes will receive additional ecological rewards (mainly OCT and USDO) based on their application contributions, further incentivising application developers to actively participate in ecosystem co-creation.
  - **Ecosystem Contribution Rewards**: Nodes that provide technical support, application development, or business promotion to the OneChain ecosystem will receive additional special rewards.

## 3. Asset Node - For institutions{/* {#section3} */}

- **Definition**: Asset nodes are oriented to all kinds of asset parties, and physical assets are put on the chain through blockchain technology.
- **Entry Conditions**: Requires staking real-world assets.
- **Eligible Entities**: Institutions holding assets like real estate, precious metals, or government bonds.
- **Entry Requirements**: Asset diversity and compliance; must align with on-chain physical asset traits (e.g., scarcity, liquidity).
- **Evaluation Criteria**:
  - Total number of purchased users (independent mobile phone or email address): 10,000 users
  - Total amount of OCT/USDO introduced: 1,000,000 new USDO
  - Trading frequency: more than 1,000 transactions per day
  - **Node Incentives**: Nodes will receive additional ecological rewards (mainly OCT and USDO) based on their asset contributions, further incentivising asset holders to actively participate in ecological co-creation

## 4.Node Incentives - Basics {/* {#section4} */}

- OneChain will launch an official activity incentive program and fully automate the distribution of rewards through smart contracts. The contribution data and reward distribution information of all nodes will be transparently recorded on the chain, users and nodes can query it in real time to ensure the fairness and trThe adjustment of the incentive mechanism (such as weight coefficient, reward rules) will be realised through on-chain governance. Nodes and token holders can jointly decide the weight and proportion of rewards for different behaviours through proposals and voting, further enhancing community participation and fairness.
- **Base Rewards**:
  - Based on the total amount of OCT staked by each node, the OCT rewards in the current cycle are proportionally distributed:
  - Formula: ![rewards](https://statics-testnet.onelabs.cc/rewards.png "rewards")
  - R(i): Base reward for node i.
  - S(i): The total amount of staked OCT for node i
  - N: Total number of nodes.
  - T_OCT: The total OCT reward pool for the current period
- At the end of each epoch, the base reward is distributed proportionally through smart contracts, ensuring that all nodes receive a fair yield based on their staked amount.

## 5. Node Incentive Mechanism - ONI (One Node Incentive) {/* {#section5} */}

- In order to incentivise nodes for their active contribution to the ecosystem, Onechain will additionally replenish a certain percentage of the USDO reward pool, and distribute the rewards through the actual contribution of the C[i] nodes based on the comprehensive calculation value.
- **Contribution Definition**:
  - **Contribution of organisation nodes**: Based on the number of new users and the quality of user activity.
  - **Contribution of application nodes**: Based on the number of transactions generated by applications and transaction activity.
  - **Contribution of asset nodes**: Based on the number of transactions generated by assets and transaction activity.
- **Contribution Reward Formula**:
  - Formula: ![oni](https://statics-testnet.onelabs.cc/oni.png "oni")
  - RE(i): Additional reward for node i.
  - C(i): The calculated value of the comprehensive contribution of node i
  - T_USDO: UUSDO reward pool for the current period
- **Comprehensively calculates the value (contribution) formula**:
  - C(i) = α⋅G(i) + β⋅A(i)
  - G(i): The number of transactions or new users generated by the app/asset
  - A(i): User activity or transaction activity
  - α, β:  Behavior weight coefficient (determined by on-chain governance)
  - The behaviour weight coefficient α and β will be dynamically adjusted according to the consensus of on-chain governance to ensure the fairness and flexibility of reward distribution.

## 6. Node ecological co-creation plan {/* {#section6} */}

#### OneChain nodes are not only the basis of technical operation, but also the core participants of ecological co-creation. {/* {#section6-1} */}
- **Ecosystem Incubation**: Nodes can propose or lead OneChain-based application development projects, such as DeFi, GameFi, cross-border payment solutions, etc. The OneChain Foundation will provide funding, technical, and market support for outstanding proposals.
- **Joint Promotion**: The node and the OneChain Foundation jointly promote the global promotion of ecological projects, especially in the fields where OneChain has advantages such as finance, entertainment, and commercial real estate, and give full play to the advantages of the node's localised resources.
- **Data Collaboration**: Nodes can participate in the analysis and utilisation of on-chain data through OneChain's DID (decentralised identity system), promote accurate services based on user portraits, and provide users with a more efficient business experience.

## 7. Node Exit Mechanism {/* {#section7} */}

#### In order to ensure the stability and security of the network, OneChain has developed a strict node exit mechanism. {/* {#section7-1} */}
- **Unlocking staked funds:**: If a node chooses to exit, it will need to unlock the staked funds after 7 cycles (about 7 days) after the withdrawal proposal takes effect to ensure that the withdrawal will not affect the operation of the network.
- **Bad Node Handling**: For nodes with insufficient online rate, malicious behaviour, or failure to fulfil their obligations, the following measures will be taken:
  - **Reduced Reward Allocation**
  - Deduct part of the staked funds as a penalty
  - Repeat violators will be permanently disqualified as validators
