  - **Ecosystem Contribution Rewards**: Nodes providing technical support, application development, or business promotion for the OneChain ecosystem receive additional specialized rewards.

## 3. Asset Nodes - Institutional Focus {/* {#section3} */}

- **Definition**: Asset nodes target asset holders, enabling the tokenization of real-world assets on the blockchain.
- **Entry Conditions**: Requires staking real-world assets.
- **Target Audience**: Institutions owning real-world assets, such as real estate, precious metals, government bonds, etc.
- **Entry Requirements**: Ecosystem diversity and compliance, with assets suitable for tokenization, such as scarce resources or highly liquid bonds.
- **Evaluation Criteria**:
  - Total purchasing users (unique phone numbers or emails): 10,000 users.
  - Total OCT/USDH acquisition: 1 million USDH added.
  - Transaction frequency: Over 1,000 transactions per day.
  - **Node Incentives**: Nodes receive additional ecosystem rewards (primarily in OCT and USDH) based on their asset contributions, further incentivizing asset holders to actively participate in ecosystem co-building.

## 4. Node Incentive Mechanism - Base {/* {#section4} */}

- OneChain will launch an official activity incentive program, with reward distribution fully automated via smart contracts. All node contribution data and reward allocation information will be transparently recorded on-chain, allowing users and nodes to query in real-time, ensuring fairness and transparency in distribution.
- Adjustments to the incentive mechanism (e.g., weight coefficients, reward rules) will be implemented through on-chain governance. Nodes and token holders can propose and vote to determine reward weights and ratios for different behaviors, enhancing community participation and fairness.
- **Base Rewards**:
  - Rewards are distributed proportionally based on each node’s total OCT staked amount for the current cycle:
  - Formula: ![rewards](https://statics-testnet.onelabs.cc/rewards.png "rewards")
  - R(i): Base reward for node i.
  - S(i): Total OCT staked by node i.
  - N: Total number of nodes.
  - T_OCT: Total OCT reward pool for the current cycle.
- At the end of each cycle, base rewards are distributed proportionally via smart contracts, ensuring all nodes receive fair returns based on their staked amount.

## 5. Node Incentive Mechanism - ONI (One Node Incentive) {/* {#section5} */}

- To encourage active contributions to the ecosystem, OneChain will supplement a certain proportion of the USDH reward pool, distributing rewards based on the comprehensive contribution score C[i] of each node.
- **Contribution Definition**:
  - **Organizational Nodes**: Based on the number of new users and the quality of user activity.
  - **Application Nodes**: Based on the number of transactions generated by applications and transaction activity.
  - **Asset Nodes**: Based on the number of transactions generated by assets and transaction activity.
- **Contribution Reward Formula**:
  - Formula: ![oni](https://statics-testnet.onelabs.cc/oni.png "oni")
  - RE(i): Additional reward for node i.
  - C(i): Comprehensive contribution score for node i.
  - T_USDH: USDH reward pool for the current cycle.
- **Comprehensive Contribution Score Formula**:
  - C(i) = α⋅G(i) + β⋅A(i)
  - G(i): Number of transactions or new users generated by applications/assets.
  - A(i): User or transaction activity level.
  - α, β: Behavioral weight coefficients (determined by on-chain governance).
  - Behavioral weight coefficients α and β will be dynamically adjusted based on on-chain governance consensus, ensuring fairness and flexibility in reward distribution.

## 6. Node Ecosystem Co-Creation Program {/* {#section6} */}

#### OneChain nodes are not only the foundation of technical operations but also core participants in ecosystem co-creation. {/* {#section6-1} */}
- **Ecosystem Incubation**: Nodes can propose or lead application development projects based on OneChain, such as DeFi, GameFi, or cross-border payment solutions. The OneChain Foundation will provide funding, technical, and market support for outstanding proposals.
- **Joint Promotion**: Nodes collaborate with the OneChain Foundation to promote ecosystem projects globally, particularly in OneChain’s key areas like finance, entertainment, and commercial real estate, leveraging nodes’ localized resource advantages.
- **Data Collaboration**: Nodes can utilize OneChain’s DID (Decentralized Identity System) to participate in on-chain data analysis and utilization, enabling precise user-profile-based services for more efficient commercial experiences.

## 7. Node Exit Mechanism {/* {#section7} */}

#### To ensure network stability and security, OneChain has established a strict node exit mechanism. {/* {#section7-1} */}
- **Stake Unlocking**: Nodes choosing to exit must wait 7 cycles (approximately 7 days) after the exit proposal takes effect to unlock staked funds, ensuring network operations are unaffected.
- **Malicious Node Handling**: For nodes with insufficient uptime, malicious behavior, or failure to fulfill obligations, the following measures will be taken:
  - **Reduced Reward Allocation**
  - Deduction of a portion of staked funds as a penalty.
  - Repeated violations will result in permanent disqualification as a validator.
